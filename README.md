Super Slinky
============

Found this sitting on an old hard drive that I'm hopefully about to sell! ໒( ͡ᵔ ▾ ͡ᵔ )७

A clone of [Slinky.js](http://slinky.iclanzan.com/) with no jQuery dependency,
section progress shown in headers, click to scroll, and the ability to resize
with a scrollbar on the window. [Written in 2014.](http://codepen.io/rileyjshaw/pen/pIFly/)
The code's nothing special, mainly putting it up because I like the logo that I
made.

Isn't it pretty??
